# V-Engines
This Matlab code will simulate the dynamic behavior of pistons and the crankshaft, under varying loads, for V Engines

The program plots the piston positions over time for both banks (left and right pistons) inside a V engine.

This code is inspired by a article on <a href="https://www.academicblock.com/technology/car-engine-technology/v-shaped-engines">V-Shaped Engines</a>.
